upgrade
=======

Debian upgrade tool, from buster to bullseye.

Requires puppet to be installed and in active use, as some assumptions
are being made about managed configuration files.

Use at your own risk.

Usage
-----

```shell
$ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Deduktiva/upgrade/main/upgrade.sh
$ tmux
$ sudo bash upgrade.sh
```
